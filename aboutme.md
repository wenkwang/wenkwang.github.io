title: About me
---
This is Yao. I am a software developer and I love coding. I keep trying to learn and explore cool stuffs in the programming world. I am glad you are here and hope you like my website. Contact me on social website or shoot me an email if you have comments want to share with me. Have fun!

### My History
I am a Chinese guy from a small, beautiful and peaceful town in midwest of China. I love my families, I love my brothers, I love my hometown, and of course, I love the food there as well. I came to America in 2013 and started my graduate study at Rutgers University. I made several brothers there and that's the most wonderful part during that time. I have been working near two years as a software developer and I am trying my best to be a better one.  
I love programming and I love technology, but I don't think that's going to be the only area I will touch in my whole life. I'd like to to be good at what I am doing, but I also would like to experience other interesting things as many as possible.
